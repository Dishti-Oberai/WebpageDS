            Student life is about learning: not only one's academic subjects and course material, but also learning to adapt and thrive in the world, make life-long friends, and acquire skills and values. The office of the Dean Students at IIT Mandi is engaged in helping students learn -- in every sense of the term -- to the best of their ability.

            The IITs have a strong tradition of encouraging students to take an active part in the life of the community. Thus, students come to organize workshops, lectures, tutorials, extra-curricular events, leisure time activities, and notably major cultural and technical festivals. The undisputed success of these events in an index of the growing self-confidence and self-reliance with which students team go about organizing them. Imperceptibly, these engagements contribute to the professionalization of the prospective engineer. If one has to answer the question how engineers come to think like engineers, the answer unerringly points to such opportunities outside the class room to articulate one's ideas, to share common goals, and to pursue them with meticulous teamwork.

            The Office of the Dean Students thus provides a framework within which students can explore the various freedoms available to them during their time here. This creates a vibrant campus atmosphere, of which all residents partake, and to which all residents contribute.
